# Assignment 0

Here's my [Overview of NLP](nlp-overview.pdf); just a basic overview of my knowledge of NLP as well as the introduction to NLP.

# [Assignment 1](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw1)

This program was a simple text processing program! It reads a CSV file, extracts and corrects the data, pickles the data, and outputs it nicely.

To run, simply type `python3 main.py <data_file>`. As an example, you may run `python3 main.py data.csv`.

Python text processing is definitely easier than other languages due to the high level support of files and strings. The advanced CSV support and other formats allows for quick processing of fancy text formats. However, there are definitely disadvantages. Python's lack of strict types and unconventional formatting makes it difficult for traditional programmers to write (such as me).

I've actually used Python in the past for an internship to do data processing and a bit of machine learning. I did get a good review on the types and some of the nuances with Python. However, I never used object-orientated Python before, so I had to learn how to write and deal with classes. I've also never touched a pickle file before.

# [Assignment 2](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw2)

This program is a guessing game, which reads from a text file and figures out the word frequencies and lexical diversities.

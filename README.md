# Assignment 0

Here's my [Overview of NLP](nlp-overview.pdf); just a basic overview of my knowledge of NLP as well as the introduction to NLP.

# [Assignment 1](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw1)

This program was a simple text processing program! It reads a CSV file, extracts and corrects the data, pickles the data, and outputs it nicely.

To run, simply type `python3 main.py <data_file>`. As an example, you may run `python3 main.py data.csv`.

Python text processing is definitely easier than other languages due to the high level support of files and strings. The advanced CSV support and other formats allows for quick processing of fancy text formats. However, there are definitely disadvantages. Python's lack of strict types and unconventional formatting makes it difficult for traditional programmers to write (such as me).

I've actually used Python in the past for an internship to do data processing and a bit of machine learning. I did get a good review on the types and some of the nuances with Python. However, I never used object-orientated Python before, so I had to learn how to write and deal with classes. I've also never touched a pickle file before.

# [Assignment 2](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw2)

This program is a guessing game, which reads from a text file and figures out the word frequencies and lexical diversities.

# [Assignment 3](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw3/wordnet.ipynb)

This notebook explores WordNet through the NLTK library.

# [Assignment 4](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw4)

We explore the ins and outs of ngrams using the NLTK library.

# [Assignment 5](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw5/sentence-parsing.pdf)

Exploration of sentence parsing using 3 different methods: PSG, dependency, and SRL.

# [Assignment 6](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw6)

Created a knowledge base by scraping a webpage. I did mine on the Hollow Knight fandom pages.

# [Assignment 7](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw7/text-classification.pdf)

Used scikit learn to perform text classification using three different methods: Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Neural Networks.

# [Assignment 8](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw8/acl-summary.pdf)

This is a summary of the paper from the ACL Long Paper Conference: [Is GPT-3 Text Indistinguishable from Human Text?
SCARECROW: A Framework for Scrutinizing Machine Text](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.501.pdf)

# [Assignment 9](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/hollow-knight-chatbot)

This is a Chatbot for Hollow Knight! The bot uses a scraped knowledge base, custom model, and Rasa to build the chat functionality. See the writeup uploaded to the repo: [Hollow Knight Chatbot Writeup](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw9/chatbot-report.pdf).

# [Assignment 10](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/nlp-class-cs4395/tree/master/src/hw10/text-classification-2.pdf)

This assignment revolves around a similar premise to Assignment 7, but this time we were building models using Keras. I used Embeddings and a RNN to classify book reviews and determine which star rating was most likely. Included in this document was also the failed attempt to classify books into genres using their descriptions.

# Assignment 11

[**My Resume**](https://cdn.michaelzhao.xyz/resume.pdf) with technical skills and soft skills!

After completing this class, I have gained a strong foundation in the essential concepts of natural language processing (NLP). I am now capable of performing morphological analysis, computing n-gram statistics and smoothing, utilizing and understanding part-of-speech taggers, and employing various parsing algorithms and techniques through Python, NLTK, and Keras/Scikit-Learn. I also have knowledge of semantic representations, including FrameNet, WordNet, PropBank, and semantic parsing techniques that use them. Additionally, I've gained an understanding of statistical machine translation and the ability to apply NLP techniques with machine learning to modern applications.

I am enthusiastic about NLP and plan to continue exploring this hot and developing field. In my future personal projects, I aim to further develop my skills and apply NLP techniques to new domains, such as personal chatbots or integrated in some larger application. To keep up with the latest advancements in NLP, I plan to continue exploring this field on my own and potentially read into more research papers on the topic. Although I may not look for an NLP-related job in the future, who knows... it might just be something that applies to all jobs one day!
